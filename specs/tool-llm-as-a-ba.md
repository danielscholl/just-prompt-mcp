Feature Request: LLM as a Business Analyst

## Implementation Notes

- Create a new tool 'business_analyst' in src/just_prompt/molecules/business_analyst_prompt.py
- Definition business_analyst_prompt(from_file: str, output_dir: str = ., models_prefixed_by_provider: List[str] = None, analyst_model: str = DEFAULT_ANALYST_MODEL, business_analyst_prompt: str = DEFAULT_ANALYST_PROMPT) -> str:
- Send the prompt from the file to the analyst_model for each model in models_prefixed_by_provider to generate business analyst briefs
- Each individual brief is saved with the format {prompt_file_stem}_{sanitized_model_name}_brief.md in the output_dir
- If multiple models are specified, create a consolidated brief, saved as business_analyst_brief.md using the CONSOLIDATION_PROMPT
- Return the path to the final brief file (either the consolidated brief or the single brief if only one model was used)
- DEFAULT_ANALYST_MODEL is openai:o3
- Create a CONSOLIDATION_PROMPT template to combine insights from multiple briefs when needed
- Be sure to validate this functionality with uv run pytest <path-to-test-file>
- After you implement, update the README.md with the new tool's functionality
- Make sure this functionality works end to end. This functionality will be exposed as an MCP tool in the server.py file.
- DEFAULT CONSOLIDATION_PROMPT template for merging multiple model briefs:
```xml
