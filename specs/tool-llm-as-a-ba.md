Feature Request: LLM as a Business Analyst

## Implementation Notes

- Create a new tool 'business_analyst' in src/just_prompt/molecules/business_analyst.py
- Definition business_analyst_prompt(from_file: str, output_dir: str = ., models_prefixed_by_provider: List[str] = None, analyst_model: str = DEFAULT_ANALYST_MODEL, business_analyst_prompt: str = DEFAULT_ANALYST_MODEL) -> None:

- Use the existing prompt_from_file_to_file function to generate a document from the 'analyst' aka models_prefixed_by_provider.
- Then run the business_analyst_prompt (xml style prompt) and the original question prompt to produce a product brief document.

- DEFAULT_ANALYST_PROMPT is
```xml

- DEFAULT_ANALYST_MODEL is openai:o3
- The prompt_from_file_to_file will output a file for the analyst's response in the output_dir.
- Be sure to validate this functionality with uv run pytest <path-to-test-file>
- After you implement update the README.md with the new tool's functionality and run `git ls-files` to update the directory tree in the readme with the new files.
- Make sure this functionality works end to end. This functionality will be exposed as an MCP tool in the server.py file.
