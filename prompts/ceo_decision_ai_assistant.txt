<purpose>
    I'm evaluating AI coding assistants to enhance developer productivity across my engineering team.
    Help me decide which tool(s) to adopt based on everything you know about them. I'm open to using a combination of tools for different needs. Here are the top 3 factors I'm considering:
</purpose>

<factors>
    1. Code Quality (Accuracy and relevance of suggestions)
    2. Developer Experience (IDE integration, usability)
    3. Cost (Pricing and licensing model)
</factors>

## 5. Combination Strategies

### Complementary Tool Pairings
| Primary Tool | Complementary Tool | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub Copilot | Claude Code | Use Copilot for quick inline suggestions + Claude for complex reasoning tasks |
| Cursor | GitHub Copilot | Cursor for project-wide changes + Copilot for focused coding sessions |
| Any Tool | Codex API | Custom integration for specialized workflows beyond standard capabilities |

### Team-Based Approaches
Different roles can benefit from different tools:
- **Frontend developers**: GitHub Copilot's strength with JavaScript/TypeScript and UI patterns
- **Backend/systems engineers**: Claude Code's reasoning capabilities for complex algorithms
- **DevOps/infrastructure**: Combination of tools with custom Codex integrations for automation

**Bottom line:**  
- **Choose GitHub Copilot alone** if seamless IDE integration and immediate productivity gains are your priority, and your team works with popular languages and frameworks.
- **Choose Claude Code alone** if you need more accurate complex code generation, better reasoning capabilities, and value detailed explanations and security focus.
- **Choose Cursor alone** if you're willing to adopt a new editor for a fully integrated AI coding experience and want powerful multi-file understanding.
- **Choose Codex API alone** if you need to build custom AI coding tools tailored to specific workflows or have specialized integration requirements.
- **Choose a combination of tools** if you want to maximize the benefits across different coding scenarios, team roles, and workflow stages. The most common combination is GitHub Copilot for day-to-day coding with Claude Code for complex reasoning tasks.

Consider running a pilot with various tool combinations to find the optimal balance between productivity enhancement and cost. Different teams within your organization may benefit from different combinations based on their specific needs.
