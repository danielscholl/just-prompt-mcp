I'd like to create an application using Python, initially for the MVP. 
It should be a Python project that's run with UV. And I'll just run this uv project locally with uv run. 
There will be no cloud integration for this project. 
When I run it without an argument it should take the top 10 trending stories from AI News.  
If I give it an argument such as AI, it should take the top 10 trending stories from AI News. 
I want it to go get all the articles from Hacker News and scrape those articles for the content. 
It also should get the top 50 comments in the comment tree of each article so we can know what people are talking about. 
Each of the top trending items with comments I want to be summarized in good detail using a LLM. 
Either a local LLM from Ollama or a Gemini LLM. 
I will take this PDF with all the information and manually send it to Notebook LLM so that I can generate a podcast.
I will listen to in the morning while I take my morning walk.
